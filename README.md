## Progress

### Monday

I started with creating some data structures and a mock API to simulate the backend. I can usually build better when I have an idea of the data flow and structure. I also set up the basic routing and navigation structure. Next, I mocked some users and CSR requests. I built the overall dashboard layout, including the sidebar, home page, and the seperate user page. User search is also functional. The mock API has delay simulation, so I was able to test loading states. With all of that, the R in CRUD is done for the most part.
